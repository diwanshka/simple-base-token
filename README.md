# Simple Base Token (SBT)

A minimal ERC-20 token contract built for the **Base** network using Solidity.

This project demonstrates how to create and deploy a simple fungible token on the Base mainnet or testnet.  
It follows the standard OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation and can be expanded for more advanced on-chain use cases.
